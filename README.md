1. Etch-a-sketch assignment for the-odin-project. Initial setup.
2. Implemented grid population and 'sketching' listener functionality.
3. Implemented 'clear-sketch' functionality.
4. Refactored to work with user defined number of cells within grid of same dimensions.
5. Added checks to keep user input within a certain range for performance reasons.
6. Fixed gridSqaure.id bug.
7. Implemented shading and refactored some sections in the process.
8. Investigated "new size" bug but doesn't seem reproducable.
9. Changed it to start at white and shade towards black. Now more of a shading pad than an etch-a-sketch.
10. Fixed "clear" functionality.
